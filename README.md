### Hi there 👋

👨‍🎓 I am a fifth-year student of Electronics and Telecommunications at the Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications, AGH, where I am the class president.

⚡ I am interested in broadly understood electronics with elements of telecommunications and IoT, with an emphasis on microcontrollers, FPGAs and embedded systems. In my free time, I try to design/construct various types of electronic gadgets and broaden my knowledge of programming. I also have basic knowledge of computer networks and digital signal processing.

👀 I am definitely not afraid to look into assembly files or linker scripts.

🪁 Zephyr contributor.

👨‍🏫 I also serve as a juror and mentor in Hackathons (BITEHack, HackYeah).
